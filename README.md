# IP-sweep
Simple Bash script that scans a network for all IP addresses that are in use.  
Takes the first 3 octets of an IPv4 address as input [xxx.xxx.xxx]  
Useful for a lab testing environment where DUT needs to have IP address set, as this will display all addresses that are currently in use.  
Will prevent issues arising from multiple devices trying to use same IP.
